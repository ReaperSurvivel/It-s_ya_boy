										<h1>Who am I?</h1>
										<p>&emsp;&emsp;I'm a 20 somethin' year old who has managed to live in the same place his entire life. Pownal Rd Auburn, ME. 
										I went to Walton Elementary, Auburn Middle School, then Edward Little High. I graduated, went to Central Maine Community College and University of Southern Maine.
										I'm currently trying to complete my bacholers in Information Technolgy. Oh, and I work helpdesk.</p>
										<h1>No No No, what are you like? Whats your persona?</h1>
										<p>&emsp;&emsp;I'm weird, like, Michael Scott from the office, weird. (That's what my Mom says anyway). Although personally, I like to think I'm casually excited by defualt, but more like Jim.
										I'm kinda a brat. I like to be the joke, play the part of a fool, mainly because I am one. I'm like 98% sure I have ADHD, which causes anxiety. I can usually only
										handle 3 things at a time. I like it when people laugh, even if its at my expense. I love to learn... When I have the motivation in me anyway. I like to care, 
										to the point that it would've caused me less trouble to just not.
										I'll gladly argue a point that doesn't matter, or stand on a hill that no one is on, just for the sake of arguement. I say a lot of stupid things because of this. 
										I want to fit in, even though I can only last 2 hours at a party before I'm mentally exhausted. I shell myself from people until I determine if they are cool or uncool. 
										Social situations cause me more internal pain then it should. It throws me in a depressive loop if I say something that people don't like. I'll mull it over the entire day,
										and ask random people if I'm at fault and for their perspective on the issue. I can talk too much sometimes, (working on that). Sometimes I feel like a paper bag, floating through the wind...
										Somehow more functional then most. I'm still green around the edges, still nieve about so many things. My parents think I do drugs but tbh thats just how my brain works. 
										I recognize the consitancy and stability that society has brought us, but I still crave the raw primal urges of choas that lies dorment in modern man. 
										I feel that Pizza is a garbage food, and pasta is a way better use of resources (I will eat it, its just not as good. You KNOW Mac n' Cheese is better).
										I've always enjoyed the art of animation, although, I fully recognize I don't have the patience to make any of it. I like to feel disconnected from reality. 
										From social obligation, school, work, etc. I can usually get by with 1 social interaction a week. Just enough to talk to an old friend for 4 hours. 
										I think the only thing I believe in is luck. It's not real, but often calculatable. 
										</p>
